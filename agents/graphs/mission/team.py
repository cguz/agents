"""The Mission Control team: which specialist owns which tools.

MCP tools reach the graph named ``<server>_<tool>``. A specialist owns every
tool whose name starts with one of its servers; the longest matching server
wins, so ``wildfire_flood`` is not mistaken for a server called ``wildfire``.
Tools no server claims go to the specialist whose servers include ``"*"``.
