"""Rule-based checks on the final answer before it reaches the user.

Two failure modes of small models, both seen live in EVE:

- They rewrite the ``/artifacts/<id>`` image links of tool results into URLs
  that do not exist. The backend already appends a correct stub for every
  image the answer does not reference, so the safe fix is to drop the image
  markdown from the answer instead of repairing it.
- They write numbers no tool returned. :func:`unsupported_numbers` lists every
  number in the answer that cannot be traced back to the evidence (the user's
  question, the tool results and the specialists' reports), so the reporter
  can be asked to fix exactly those.
